    "# 1. Introduction to MOA Machine Learning for Streams\n",
    "https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/  \n",
    "\"MOA is the most popular open source framework for data stream mining, with a very active growing community (blog). It includes a collection of machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems) and tools for evaluation. Related to the WEKA project, MOA is also written in Java, while scaling to more demanding problems.\"\n",
    "**It is written in Java.** Unfortunatelly I am more comfortable with Python & PySpark. I also noticed that Python (and R) libraries often have much better documentation than anything in Java (my opinion).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 ways to use MOA :\n",
    "  1. GUI - download prebuild MOA from official webpage or build the most current version from GitHub\n",
    "    GUI is easy to use - if you know what you are looking for :D\n",
    "  2. command line - run experiments by commands (or scripts), commands are show also in GUI and can be grouped to create scripts, for examples see:  \n",
    "    https://github.com/5uperpalo/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine-Learning-Tools/weka_moa_elki_pig.md\n",
    "  3. java code - run the code or use jupyter notebook\n",
