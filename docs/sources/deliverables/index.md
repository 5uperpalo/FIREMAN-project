# D4.4: Software Executable for Data Reduction

The objective of Deliverable 4.4 is to provide the source code of the data aggregation methods developed in Task 4.2. The codes are a follow-up of the [D4.2](https://fireman-project.eu/attachments/article/27/FIREMAN_Deliverable_D4_2%20(1).pdf).

Specifically, this deliverable reports the algorithms used in the paper [Fault detection and classification in Industrial IoT
in case of missing sensor data](https://fireman-project.eu/attachments/article/27/Fault_detection_and_classification_in_Industrial_IoT_in_case_of_missing_sensor_data.pdf).
